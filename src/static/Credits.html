        <br>This Year From March to June<br>
        4 brave Warriors/Students embarked on a journey <br>
        to make the best game for the hot summer days.<br>
        They are known as<br>
        EMIL,<br>
        MAHYAR,<br>
        MUHAMED<br>
        and<br>
        PHILIP.<br>
        Together with the help of teachers and mentors at Malm√∂ University,<br>
        they put pain, sweat, and maybe a few tears to make this game and possibly get a passing grade.<br>
        If you are reading this whole credits, you deserved one extra life,<br>
        but unfortunately we couldn't implement that in code.<br>
        THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT AND PLAYING OUR GAME<br>
        Hopefully, you liked it.
        <br> We want to say thank you to the<br>
        StackOverflow community, @ChrisCourses on YouTube and freeCodeCamp.org for helping us with our coding struggles.
